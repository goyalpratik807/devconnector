# DevConnector 2.0

> Social network for developers

This is a MERN stack application. It is a small social network app that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.


Install axios in the root of the project

```bash
npm i axios
```

We can then remove the client installation of axios.

```bash
cd client
npm uninstall axios
```

Client use of the axios module will be resolved in the root, so we can still use it in client.

Change the above GitHub API request to..

```js
const uri = encodeURI(
  `https://api.github.com/users/${req.params.username}/repos?per_page=5&sort=created:asc`
);
const headers = {
  'user-agent': 'node.js',
  Authorization: `token ${config.get('githubToken')}`
};

const gitHubResponse = await axios.get(uri, { headers });
```

You can see the full change in [routes/api/profile.js](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devconnector_2.0/blob/4be414c6a54994c18397dba9c927ad67b878508b/routes/api/profile.js#L324)

## uuid no longer has a default export


change

```js
import uuid from 'uuid';
```

to

```js
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
```

And where we use it from

```js
const id = uuid();
```

to

```js
const id = uuidv4();
```


## Redux subscription to manage local storage üì•

The rules of redux say that our [reducers should be pure](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers#handling-actions) and do just one thing.

If you're not familiar with the concept of pure functions, they must do the following..

1. Return the same output given the same input.
2. Have no side effects.

So our reducers are not the best place to manage local storage of our auth token.
Ideally our action creators should also just dispatch actions, nothing else. So using these for additional side effects like setting authentication headers is not the best solution here.

Redux provides us with a [`store.subscribe`](https://redux.js.org/api/store#subscribelistener) listener that runs every time a state change occurs.

We can use this listener to **_watch_** our store and set our auth token in local storage and axios headers accordingly.

- if there is a token - store it in local storage and set the headers.
- if there is no token - token is null - remove it from storage and delete the headers.



## Component reuse ‚ôªÔ∏è

The EditProfile and CreateProfile have been reduced to one component [ProfileForm.js]
The majority of this logic came from the refactrored EditProfile Component.

## Log user out on token expiration üîê

If the Json Web Token expires then it should log the user out and end the authentication of their session.

We can do this using a [axios interceptor](https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors) together paired with creating an instance of axios.  
The interceptor, well... intercepts any response and checks the response from our api for a `401` status in the response.  
ie. the token has now expired and is no longer valid, or no valid token was sent.  
If such a status exists then we log out the user and clear the profile from redux state.

# Quick Start üöÄ

### Add a default.json file in config folder with the following

```
{
  "mongoURI": "<your_mongoDB_Atlas_uri_with_credentials>",
  "jwtSecret": "secret",
  "githubToken": "<yoursecrectaccesstoken>"
}
```

### Install server dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install client dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Run both Express & React from root

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### Test production before deploy

After running a build in the client üëÜ, cd into the root of the project.  
And run...

```bash
NODE_ENV=production node server.js
```

Check in browser on [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

### Deploy to Heroku

If you followed the sensible advice above and included `config/default.json` `and config/production.json` in your .gitignore file, then pushing to Heroku will omit your config files from the push.  
However, Heroku needs these files for a successful build.  
So how to get them to Heroku without commiting them to GitHub?

What I suggest you do is create a local only branch, lets call it _production_.

```bash
git checkout -b production
```

We can use this branch to deploy from, with our config files.

Add the config file...

```bash
git add -f config/production.json
```

This will track the file in git on this branch only. **DON'T PUSH THE PRODUCTION BRANCH TO GITHUB**

Commit...

```bash
git commit -m 'ready to deploy'
```

Create your Heroku project

```bash
heroku create
```

And push the local production branch to the remote heroku master branch.

```bash
git push heroku production:master
```

Now Heroku will have the config it needs to build the project.

> **Don't forget to make sure your production database is not whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas, otherwise the database connection will fail and your app will crash.**

After deployment you can delete the production branch if you like.

```bash
git checkout master
git branch -D production
```

Or you can leave it to merge and push updates from another branch.  
Make any changes you need on your master branch and merge those into your production branch.

```bash
git checkout production
git merge master
```

Once merged you can push to heroku as above and your site will rebuild and be updated.
